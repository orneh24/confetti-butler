"""UDP syslog receiver for lab-butler.

Listens on UDP/514 in a daemon thread and stores parsed messages in the same
SQLite database as everything else, so a message can later be joined against
devices.device_aliases (by source_ip) when the syslog page renders — see
app.py's api_syslog, which resolves device_id at query time rather than at
insert time, so a device added or re-addressed after a message arrives still
correlates retroactively.

Deliberately minimal: no relay, no TLS, no authentication. UDP syslog is
lossy and anything on the segment can inject into it — this is a
troubleshooting aid, never an audit trail. Ported near-verbatim from
mesh-flux's hub/app/syslog_server.py; the parsing logic and every hazard
it guards against (constraints 17, 18, 20 in mesh-flux's CLAUDE.md) are
identical here — lab-butler has a syslog listener as a second writer
against the same database exactly as mesh-flux's hub does.
